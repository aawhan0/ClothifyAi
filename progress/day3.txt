i had to uninstall opencv-python-headless, because it was disabling the gui popups.

i also changed pose_image.py imshow to imwrite to avoid gui issues.

-> MAJOR PROGRESS:
    almost everything is going smooth, its just that the garment_masked.png isnt imposing properly on person_masked properly.
    for that, I now have to study on how to set landmarks for neck, sleeve etc. Mediapipe wont allow me to do that as it is not 
    made for garments, and for just Body Landmarks.

    I have used an external src repo. Now i need to do some changes as resizing the sample.jpg and stuff
    I got to know about Conda;
    
    Conda: an Open source package used for python and scientific computing. Unlike PIP this manages packages for any 
    language. Helps to handle environment setups across different platforms and languages.
    
    

-> INSTALLATIONS:
    I installed scikit-image library.


-> IMPLEMENTATIONS:
    I need to define two things:
    1. Source points- Keypoints on the garment image
    2. Destination points- Corresponding keypoints on the person image
    
    but this would not be feasible. cant manually do this for every garment image.
    Hence, I will be using some open source framework for this.
