i had to uninstall opencv-python-headless, because it was disabling the gui popups.

i also changed pose_image.py imshow to imwrite to avoid gui issues.

-> MAJOR PROGRESS:
    almost everything is going smooth, its just that the garment_masked.png isnt imposing properly on person_masked properly.
    for that, I now have to study on how to set landmarks for neck, sleeve etc. Mediapipe wont allow me to do that as it is not 
    made for garments, and for just Body Landmarks.
