# ClothifyAi

An AI-powered virtual try-on platform that allows users to virtually wear clothing items by combining body pose estimation and generative image synthesis. This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to provide realistic and interactive virtual fitting experiences. It is designed for fashion tech applications and e-commerce innovation.

## Features

- Real-time body pose estimation using [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)  
- Garment segmentation and alignment based on pose keypoints  
- Conditional GANs for photorealistic garment texture synthesis  
- Support for input images and live video for interactive try-on  
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation and improvement

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- GPU-enabled environment recommended for training generative models  
- CUDA Toolkit (if using NVIDIA GPU)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ClothifyAi.git
cd ClothifyAi

text

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

text

3. Install required Python packages:  
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

- Use the [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) dataset or any other suitable fashion dataset.  
- Instructions for dataset preprocessing are in the `docs/DATA_PREPARATION.md` file.

## Usage

### Pose Estimation Demo

Run the pose estimation script to detect and visualize keypoints on images or webcam feed:  
python pose_estimation.py --input path/to/image_or_video

text

### Virtual Try-On Demo

Run the main try-on script for generating virtual try-on results:  
python virtual_tryon.py --user_img path/to/user_image --cloth_img path/to/cloth_image

## Model Training

- Details for training GAN models for garment synthesis are in `docs/TRAINING.md`.  
- Pretrained models and checkpoints will be made available.
